# Mau-Mau
This game is played with a Skat hand of 32 cards: there are eight different values (seven, eight, nine, ten, jack, queen, king and ace) in four different so-called Colours (clubs, spades, hearts and diamonds). Each combination of value and color occurs exactly once in a Skat deck.
This game was an assignment from Progra winter term 20/21 (computer science @ RWTH Aachen University).
